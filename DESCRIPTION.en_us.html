    Bagel Fat is a very heavy/fat font with rounded details. By these rounded corners, the overall mood is cute and lovely which is inspired by bread, pastries and sweets. Also a large contrast at where the horizontal and the vertical stroke come across makes it unique, not just cute.

    JAMO is a type design collective group based in Seoul, Korea. We provide professional education, information, and discussion to designers who are wishing to develop their own typefaces through our workshop. JAMO encourages more experimental and unconventional typeface design by getting inspirations from old types, finding an alternative usage from existing ones, and suggesting new letterforms for the future. We aim to escape from the passive practice and create more self-initiating active typefaces. JAMO offers high-quality typeface design based on the deep levels of research, planning, and study. By broadening the potential of Hangul, we propose a new type design methodology to co-live with other worldwide letters including the Latin Alphabet.
